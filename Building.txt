Building TASKBAR                               			02 Apr 2003
================

TASKBAR is designed to make mousing about the old desktop a bit easier.  It 
allows you to assign various commands to your mouse buttons with or without 
keyboard modifiers.  It also provides optional clipboard management and 
extension, swapfile monitor, desktop clock, virtual desktops, screen capture, 
file dialog enhancement, titlebar enhancement and some other mouse-related 
options.  Sorry, kitchen sink not included. TASKBAR requires OS/2 Warp (3.x+) or 
better.
